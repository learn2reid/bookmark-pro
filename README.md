# Bookmark Pro

Save native Chrome bookmarks faster.

If you're a power user of Chrome's basic bookmarks, then you're probably not very satisfied with the experience of saving bookmarks in Chrome.

This extension replaces Chrome's default Save Bookmark popup with a new popup experience that has modern, search-empowered features and a clean design. (Note: This extension does not work when using Google's newer Bookmark Manager extension.)

- Start typing to smart-search for a folder instead of digging through a menu for it.
- Choose from 3 recently-saved-to folders without searching for a folder at all.
- Create and save to a new folder without needing to open a new popup.
- Update the location or delete the bookmark if you've already saved the page.
- Elegantly designed using Google's new Material Design language.
- Highlighted a favorite quote? It'll automatically be prepended to the bookmark title.

## How Does It Work? Keyboard Shortcuts?

- Bookmark the same way you always have, whether through the Bookmarks menu, star icon, or keyboard shortcut (Mac: Cmd + D, Others: Ctrl+D)
- Tab to jump between inputs, ESC to escape, and Enter to Save, just as you'd expect.
